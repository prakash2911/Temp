1)I migrated five services using Java Spring Boot from a pagination-based system to a report endpoint that retrieves all data in one go, aligning with Barclays' value of **Excellence** by simplifying and streamlining processes. This improved the accuracy and efficiency of data retrieval, ensuring consistent outcomes for clients, in line with our commitment to **Service** and **Integrity**. Additionally, I developed SFTP scripts for secure file transfers between UTIF and IMAtch. Currently, I am also working on a frontend to assist with post-implementation testing, ensuring a smooth transition and reliable results, reflecting **Stewardship** in my work.


2)In my recent projects, I have prioritized delivering quality products and services that align with Barclays' strategic goals. By migrating five services to a report endpoint, I transitioned from a cumbersome pagination approach to a streamlined method that retrieves all data in a single call. This shift not only enhances operational efficiency but also strengthens our ability to meet risk and control requirements effectively.
Moreover, I developed secure SFTP scripts for file transfers between UTIF and IMAtch, addressing underlying issues and driving long-term sustainability. Currently, I am focusing on a frontend solution for post-implementation testing, which will enhance our service delivery and build long-term client relationships. These initiatives aim to enhance our reputation and create a positive impact on the communities we serve, reflecting Barclays’ commitment to excellence.


3)In my role, I ensure precision in operations, risk management, and controls by adhering strictly to relevant rules, regulations, and codes of conduct. For example, in migrating five services to the report endpoint, I established streamlined processes that enhance data accuracy and reliability, ensuring compliance with Barclays’ operational standards. 
I actively follow and improve our control mechanisms by proactively identifying and managing risks associated with these processes. This includes implementing secure SFTP scripts for file transfers, where I have carefully evaluated and escalated any potential risks, ensuring that our practices align with security protocols and regulatory requirements.
As I develop the frontend for post-implementation testing, my focus remains on delivering accurate and reliable outcomes that adhere to the necessary policies and limits. By continuously strengthening our controls and maintaining operational integrity, I contribute to the long-term sustainability of our services and build trust with our clients and stakeholders.


4)In my role, I am deeply committed to promoting diversity of thought and fostering an inclusive culture within our team. I believe that bringing together individuals from diverse backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives is essential for driving innovation and challenging the status quo.

By embracing diversity and equity, I strive to create an environment where everyone feels valued and empowered to share their ideas. I prioritize collaboration and open dialogue, ensuring that all voices are heard and considered. This inclusive approach not only enhances problem-solving but also contributes to a supportive workplace culture that promotes recognition and wellbeing for all team members.

As I work on developing the frontend for post-implementation testing, I am dedicated to integrating diverse perspectives and feedback, ensuring that our solutions meet the needs of all clients and customers.

5)I prioritize designing world-class products and services with our clients at the center, ensuring we deliver quality outcomes that provide fair value and avoid foreseeable harm. I focus on supporting vulnerable circumstances by balancing short-term needs with long-term sustainability, aligning our efforts with Barclays' ESG (Environmental, Social, and Corporate Governance) outcomes. As I develop the frontend for post-implementation testing, I incorporate stakeholder feedback to create solutions that are accessible and beneficial for all clients.



In my role, I have made significant progress toward achieving key objectives by prioritizing quality, efficiency, and inclusivity in all my projects. I successfully migrated five services to a report endpoint, enhancing data retrieval processes and delivering more reliable outcomes for our clients. I actively promote diversity of thought within the team, ensuring all voices are heard and valued, which fosters innovation and better problem-solving.

Additionally, I developed secure SFTP scripts to improve file transfer reliability and am currently working on a frontend for post-implementation testing to further enhance our service delivery. Through these initiatives, I have demonstrated a commitment to Barclays' values and strategic priorities, driving sustainable long-term performance while maintaining a strong focus on risk management and compliance. Overall, I believe my contributions have positively impacted our clients and reinforced our reputation for excellence.



To manage risk and strengthen controls, I have implemented several key initiatives.
